# Divided-Sequencer
2 frequency divided clock with 11 divisions each, five 10-step Sequencers, and 15 VCOs.
Not tested yet, do not use!!
Working on: 
1. Add two sets of interfaces between each group of components,
2. Trying out the actual sound with different resistence/capacity values 
3. Use LM555 to replace 40106/4046, referring to https://blog.tommy.sh/posts/prototype-post-mortem-four-step-octaved-sequencer/ this design.
4. Have fun!
